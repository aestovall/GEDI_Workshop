# Become a GEDI Master

![](images/GEDI_title.png)

## Overview of Course

Join our workshop and become a GEDI Master. The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) is the first full waveform LiDAR instrument on the international space station developed by NASA specifically for measuring forest structure at a global scale. Unlock the huge potential of GEDI in your scientific study. Attendees will learn how to download L2A and L2B data in your own area of interest while becoming familiar with the GEDI data structure. Then we will extract metrics of elevation, height, canopy cover, plant area index, and many more! Finally, you will learn how to use GEDI L4A footprint biomass to estimate biomass in your study area and begin the process of creating wall-to-wall biomass maps using machine learning. By the end of training you will surely become a GEDI master.
